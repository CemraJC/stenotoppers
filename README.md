# Alternative StenoToppers Formats

In case you don't have access to AutoDesk Inventor, these models may be easier
to modify for your own personal use. Note that you will not be able to push
your contributions to the git repository by making modifications to these
files - the root files are still the AutoDesk Inventor part files.

For simple changes (a dimension tweak here or there) open an issue and these
changes may be made for you (if acceptable).

If you wish to contribute complex changes, unfortunately you must find a way
to access AutoDesk Inventor (student editions are available for free).
