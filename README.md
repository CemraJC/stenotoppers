We recommend printing two standard keycaps (`standard-keycap.stl`) to confirm that they actually fit on your keyboard without any/much interference. If it does not, then your 3D printer likely needs calibration.

The test assembly (`test-print.stl`) is an optional next stage for those who wish to make absolutely certain that all the keycap types will fit and that the standard keycaps will line up properly before printing all of them. Recommend printing at lower quality and hollow / 10% infill to save time and a bit of material.

The final print assembly (`final-print.stl`) contains all the keys needed for a full set of StenoToppers.

<!-- TODO: Update this list -->
Make sure to see the [fitting guide][fitting-guide] for properly fitting the keys to your keyboard.
