Decided to pull ALPS switch design from the roadmap, because not enough people are using them. If a need arises, we'll see what we can do. Also pulled the backlit variant from the roadmap because if you need to look at your stenotype, then that's probably bad.

Also made some important design changes for clearance around the Cherry MX pole and a shortening in the keycap to allow it space to be pressed down.

Added some aesthetic features as well.
