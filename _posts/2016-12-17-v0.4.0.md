Some major changes to the Cherry MX pole design that will make it possible to print. Previously, the pole was cylindrical and had very thin walls that would have caused problems for the printer. Now, the minimum thickness at any point should always be greater than 1mm (enough for a reasonable printer to handle).

Also added a draft angle to the ribbing.

Note that the keyboard mockup and drawing are likely broken now.
