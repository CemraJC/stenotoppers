**First release of 2017!**

In this release, the resolution of the parts is increased for more accurate printing. The dimensions of the parts are verified with real-world cross measurements made at 0.01 tolerances. All that is left is a test print and fit!

Also decreased the depth of the Cherry MX Pole cut in some more.
