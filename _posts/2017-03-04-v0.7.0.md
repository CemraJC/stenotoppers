**A full test print has been made from 0.6**

The test print was a success, but some aesthetic changes need to be made. Variations in key switch thickness has caused some of the StenoToppers to be looser than desired. The decision was made to reduce the tolerances on the models at the risk of them not fitting anymore. As it is much easier to file material off than it is to graft more on, the lower tolerances will cause less problems overall.

From first impressions, the keys are a lot easier to press and chording G and Z is relatively easy now.
