**A full test print has been made from 0.6**

The test print didn't fit as tightly as I would have liked, so I have redone the tolerances and I am going to do another test print. I can still use the ones from 0.6, but I don't think they're going to last in the long term. I can feel that most of them are just held on by waste material. So, they won't last too much longer.

But, I am very happy with how close and about out of the way everything is. My thumbs are relaxed and I can press a G or a Z with ease. Love it.

I can feel the end of this project coming along nicely.
