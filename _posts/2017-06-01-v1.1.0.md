status: Full Release (Minor Addition)

The StenoToppers set now has number bar keys! These keys are nice and square, fitting together to effectively form a number bar look-alike best as we can.

Nothing else has changed in this release, so if you already have a StenoToppers set, you can go ahead and print just a number bar for yourself (make sure you test one numbar key first!). If you haven't printed any StenoToppers, then it's up to you whether or not you want to print the full assembly with the number bar keys as well - or just the letter keys.
