This folder would contains models adapted for the ALPS keyswitch design.

Note that these models, although potentially useful, do not yet exist because
it was decided that Cherry MX switches are more common. Regardless, if a serious
need for ALPS switch variants of the StenoToppers arises, then the models will
go here.

This project is structured to allow for addition of alternative
keyswitch affixing systems.
