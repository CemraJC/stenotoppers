                <h1>About StenoToppers</h1>
                <p>
                    A <i>StenoTopper</i> is a 3D printed keycap set that aims to optimize a mechanical keyboard for stenography - when used in conjunction with the <a href={{ site.urls.plover }}>Plover</a> software. The set achieves this by raising, aligning and compacting the keys, making it easier to press multiple keys as required. It also moves the steno keys away from the surrounding keys, such as the spacebar, making stenotyping <i>much</i> more comfortable.
                </p>
            </section>
            <!-- Add a showcase section (with 3 diagrams) that displays how stenotoppers do their job -->

                <h1>Why you should care</h1>
                <p>
                    As it stands, QWERTY was <i>designed</i> to make it difficult to press multiple keys at once. Theoretically, this is good, but since the whole premise of the stenotype <i>is</i> to press multiple keys at once, we clearly have a problem. StenoToppers and other similar solutions (like the <a href={{ site.urls.laser-keytoppers }}>Laser-cut Keytoppers</a>) are designed to counteract the problem with QWERTY's anti-chordal design.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Stenographers using Plover on a QWERTY keyboard tend to notice that the annoying and sometimes painful process of avoiding the spacebar, slanting your fingers (to line up with the keyboard's row staggering) and bending thumbs and pinkie fingers into unnatural shapes to overcome the substantial gap between keys. With StenoToppers, one can align the rows, raise them above the spacebar and move the keys closer in one fell swoop. StenoToppers help you reclaim your <a href={{ site.urls.ergonomics }}>ergonomic advantage</a>.
                </p>

            <section>
                <h1>How to get some</h1>
                <p>
                Currently, StenoToppers are only available through <a href={{ site.urls.fdm-printing }}>3D printing</a>. This is because, although very useful, they are only useful for a relatively small number of people. Demand for units would need to be in the 10,000's to make mass production viable.
                </p>

                <p>
                If you already have access to a 3D printer, then you should be able to download the models from above and print them for negligible cost (about $2.50 worth of filament, duration of 12 hours). If, like the rest of us, you <i>don't</i> have access to a 3D printer, you will need to utilize a 3D printing service like <a href={{ site.urls.shapeways }}>Shapeways</a> (costs about $COST_EST). When using Shapeways, you can upload and configure the models yourself or you can <a href={{ site.urls.shapeways-upload }}>use the ones already uploaded</a> for free (well, there is the print cost).</p>
