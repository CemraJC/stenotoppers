Welcome to the StenoTopper "source code"! Do you like what I did with the
"Hello" above? Keycaps! It's funny, right? No? Oh well - it's pretty chill
down here in the HTML, so feel free to relax for a minute or two.

The fact that you're reading this means you're either an interesting person
whom the world appreciates - or you're a teenager trying to look cool with the
devtools open. Since this is a webpage primarily about stenography, I am very
inclined to believe the former - so, hello interesting person!

Oh, and P.S - if you want the real source code, head on over to the Github
repository (link is on this page). For the site, it's in the "gh-pages" branch

Meanwhile, I'm going to relax...

                <p>
                    <b>StenoToppers</b> are a 3D printed keycap set made to optimize a mechanical keyboard for stenography. They are intended for use in conjunction with <a href="{{ site.urls.plover }}">Plover</a>, the stenotype emulation software. StenoToppers augment Plover by making steno <i>much</i> more comfortable.

                <h1>Why you need StenoToppers</h1>
                <p>
                    As it stands, QWERTY was <i>designed</i> to make it difficult to press multiple keys at once. This is good for normal typing, but since the whole idea of the stenotype is to press multiple keys at once, we clearly have a problem. StenoToppers and other similar solutions (like the <a href="{{ site.urls.laser-keytoppers }}">Laser-cut Keytoppers</a>) are designed to counteract the problems with QWERTY's anti-chordal design.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Using the methods shown above, StenoToppers help you reclaim your <a href="{{ site.urls.ergonomics }}">ergonomic advantage</a>.
                </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h1>How to print some</h1>
                <p>
                    Currently, StenoToppers are only available through <a href="{{ site.urls.fdm-printing }}">3D printing</a>.
                    If you already have access to a 3D printer, then you should be able to download the models from above and print them for negligible cost (about $3 worth of filament, duration of 12 hours).
                </p>

                <p>
                    If, like the rest of us, you <i>don't</i> have access to a 3D printer, you will need to use a 3D printing service like <a href="{{ site.urls.shapeways }}">Shapeways</a> (costs about $110, then shipping). When using Shapeways, you can upload and configure the models yourself or you can <a href="{{ site.urls.shapeways-upload }}">use the ones already uploaded</a> for free (well, there is still the massive print cost). Other services may be marginally cheaper.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Online printing is very expensive and there's limited purchase security. What if something goes wrong with the print? When pushing $100, you might want to look around carefully for other options. Maybe you can pay a friend to print them for you? Look around for a friendly maker space&em;we're sure they'll happily accommodate you. If you always wanted a 3D printer, but could never justify the initial outlay, now's your chance!
                </p>

                <p>
                    Here is an overview of the steps to print some StenoToppers on your own printer:
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Download the models zip file above</li>
                    <li>Locate the <code>standard-keycap.stl</code> file</li>
                    <li>Load this file into your slicing software and do a draft-quality test print</li>
                    <li>Confirm that the keycap fits properly. If not, make sure you have calibrated your printer and go back to step 3</li>
                    <li>If all is well, print another draft and confirm that they align properly and don't clash</li>
                    <li>Finally, locate the <code>final-print.stl</code> assembly and print it at your desired quality.</li>
                    <li>When the print is done, spend a bit of time cleaning up the models and polishing them off. Refer to the <a href="{{ site.urls.fitting-guide }}">fitting guide for more detail</a>.</li>
                    <li>Enjoy your brand new StenoToppers!</li>
                </ol>
